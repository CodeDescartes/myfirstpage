        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>I live in San Francisco with my wife and dog.</p>
        <p>
          I'm a philosophy lecturer looking to develop my web programming
          skillset.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially in college, I planned on obtaining a degree in programming,
          so I learned C, and Java. However, after taking some General Education
          courses, philosophy left an impact on me so much that I decided to
          become a philosophy major.
        </p>
        <p>
          After being recently laid-off from SF State University, I've decided
          to pursue programming as a side career/hobby to make the rent.
        </p>
        <p>So, this is my first webpage!</p>
